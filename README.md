# Odin Recipes
Welcome to the Recipes Project, a simple HTML-based website built as part of the Foundations Course from The Odin Project. This project serves as an introduction to basic HTML structure, giving hands-on experience with creating and linking multiple web pages.

This project is basically one of my first projects using HTML where I applied all knowledge that I acquired on my journey through the first 33% of foundations of The Odin Project Course.

Website represents a basic recipe catalog containing three different recipes.
