# Odin Recipes 📝
**Welcome to the Recipes Project**, a simple HTML-based website built as part of the Foundations Course from The Odin Project. 

This project is basically one of my first projects using HTML where I applied all knowledge that I acquired on my journey through the first 33% of foundations of The Odin Project Course.

Website represents a basic recipe catalog containing three different recipes.
